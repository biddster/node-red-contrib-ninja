# node-red-contrib-ninja

A node-red module which allows one to control a Ninja Block.

## Installation

Change directory to your node-red installation and issue:

    $ npm install node-red-contrib-ninja
    
## Usage and configuration
    
In this repo there is example-flow.json. You can import that into a node-red workspace and it will provide a template
        for getting working with the Ninja Block.
        
Further documentation will follow in time.
